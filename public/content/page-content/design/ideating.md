# Ideating

## How do you know what you are building?
Before one starts hammering out lines of code, one needs to know towards what end they are trying to hammer out these lines of code. This is not in any form a profound statement, but often times we forget that we need to know this. Many of us may come from the world of competitive programming or university level assignments. In a way we are spoiled because the end goal is predefined and we just have to get there. In fact, there is almost always an understanding that the answer is out there, it is just that we don't know it. If we look hard enough we are bound to find it in the depths of the internet - Google almost guarantees it.
But ideating in the real world is exponentially harder, because the goals are not always clear. If you are in a large organization or starting up or even part of a team in a startup that is trying to start a new project, most requirements follow from one of two points:
* Implement a business or technology goal that will make the business money.
* Implement a workflow that may not make the business money but will have some set of people who have live improving value in it.

Lets spend some time breaking these two points down. 

## Building for profit
Whether your company is a capitistic for-profit or even a not-for-profit, chances are your still need to worry about how you are going to pay for costs of running the business. There are salaries to be paid and lights to be kept on. However not-for-profits are bound to feed back whatever operating profits that are made into the business itself. For-profit companies will distribute the money to share-holders and founders who are then free to use this money for their personal reasons to feedback into the ecosystem.

This long explanation is to say that fundamentally all that gets built in a company has to, through some roundabout way, answer for how that is going to make money. While an engineer or even a senior engineer may be far removed from having to answer this question in a large company, it is the bread and butter of any small team. A mistake made all too often by engineers of any level of experience is that they build for the love of building something, and many times it is not too clear how to monetize what they have built or even if there is any way it can improve productivity.

A caveat here is, not all work has to have direct dollar signs attached to them. It can be as simple as improving the workflow of the customer service team that can allow them to increase throughput (number of customer queries resolved per hour) that will lead to more customers that will then increase the business revenue.

## Building for free
Not all people of companies fall under the category mentioned above. Some organizations build software for public good. Major examples are those that come from the government. The software that allows you book an appointment at the passport office or any other government service have been built to help society by allowing the government to efficiently fulfill its duty. For example, one of the driving factors is here is the number of appointments issued given free slots and the number of people who want to issue one. The closer to 100% the software is in this ratio, the more successful it is. Since this is a necessary service given to citizens by the government, the main aim is not how much money it is, but the happiness of its customers, i.e., the citizens of the country. 

Alternatively there are many complex economies at play for giving away something for free. Some companies are designed to give away work for free or token amounts. Examples include the free software movement, operating systems such as linux, and companies such as Canonical, the makers of the Ubuntu OS. If Microsoft and Apple can make a lot of money selling Windows and MacOS-based systems respectively, why would Canonical want to give away Ubuntu for free. There are many reasons one of which is Ubuntu is open-source and built by the community which means it is only fair they release it back to the community for free. How do they make money? After all the CEO of Ubuntu is one of richest men in the world. They make money by selling support to enterprise customers.

## Building for Value.
But given both of these sections, the common denominator is they are both building for value. In both cases, the truest acid-test of the success of a product is if whether people are using it or not. To make a profit first you have to make a revenue and to make a revenue, people will have to want to use your product and pay for it. And they will pay for it only if they find value. In the second case, the reason you are building something is to have people use it and better their own lives or society, and people are not going to use it if doesn't deliver them value. 

## How do you find the Value?
It is easy to retrospectively laud successful companies, projects and people, without considering the multiple companies that tried and failed on the way. For example, we all know Facebook as one of the most successful social media platforms of the last decade, but how many of us remember Orkut and its demise. This retrospective judgement of a space or sector by looking at only those who were successful and not considering the failures on the way is called *survivorship bias.*

The issue with survivorship bias is it does not paint a true picture of what it really was for these companies before they were deemed succesful. Many people will look at *Lufthansa* or *Emirates* as examples of how to run an airline, but what about the countless other airlines that ran and closed up?
Most of the founders of these companies would believe that what they are the next billion dollar company. But only a few of them were right.

There is no covering up, finding value is a hard task. Not least due to the multiple factors that finally deam the product valuable. For any product, the proof is only in the pudding. It can be deemed valuable only if people have actually used it and are paying for it. Predicting a product is valuable before it actually is lies in the realm of tech pundits and venture capilitists. Startup founders to play the game will also have to tout the predicted value in their product before actually showing it if they have hopes of raising capital from investors. However, the success rate for startups are in the low single digit percentage points (proof?). That means your startup is nine times out of ten going to fail than succeed.

These seems very stark, and might put you off your course and make you rethink starting up, but it is not. We hope this is just a coffee shot that you need and probably hold on to understand that at no point in your journey can you relax and you need to constantly keep reevaluating whether you are still showing value or you are not.

## Can you be more pointed?

Sure, to be more pointed we can deliver different take aways from this section to different readers:

### Startup Founders
  
Depending on where you are on your journey you may feel we are only preaching to the choir here. If you have already started up, raised capital and a team, you may have already done the exercise of describing potential value in your product multiple times, to mutliple startup meets and investors. If you are early in your journey or are just about thinking of taking the leap in to starting up, this can be a very important step.

Many founders especially those from an engineering background may have cool tech but have no idea about whether it is actually valuable (projected or not) or can improve the lives of their users in such a way that they would pay money for the product. If you fall under this category, the takeaway is always be clear about the value of your idea. The whole point of the startup is to prove the value before you become a full blown company that is cruising along the market.

### Product Managers 

If you are a product manager or vice-president of a new product in a larger company, a large portion of your journey designing, building and proving value will be the same as the founder of a startup. The only difference would be those who are external investors in a startup would now be the higher up decision-makers in your organization. That and the fact that you will have more help given the other existing teams in the organization, but that depends on how green-field your project is. 

Few times a project may come from above but this would still rests on your shoulders to define the value, define the roadmap to get there, and prove that the value has been attained.

### Team leads and New Engineers

If anyone the page should have the most effect on, it is on early career engineers. It is all too easy for you, if you are engineer reading this, to wear blinders and concentrate on small portions of work that have been handed to you from above, but one trick that can help you grow is in asking this question continuously. Don't hesitate to ask yourself first and then ask your peers and those ranked higher than you in the organization, what the value is in what you are building. Breaking down the product, its possible value and impact can not only benefit you but also how you engineer your work. 

For example, if you are the front-end engineer working on a consumer app, you may learn from your decision maker that any point speed and functionality are more important than aesthetics. If your task involves something as simple (it is not that simple) placing a new button, and you now have a choice between one implementation that can be aesthetic, but you have to sacrifice speed or download a new package that will increase the load time, you already know your answer. 

And if you have a personal opinion, you can even share it, sometimes you would be the only one who knows the trade-off between two packages, and if you understand the mindset of the decision makers you can probably already make the decision for them, and when you tell them you did and they agree it was the right decision, that is time and cognitive load saved for you and them.
