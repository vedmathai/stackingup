# Ideating

## How do you know what you are building?
Before one starts hammering out lines of code, one needs to know towards what end they are trying to hammer out these lines of code. This is not in any form a profound statement, but often times we forget that we need to know this. Many of us may come from the world of competitive programming or university level assignments. In a way we are spoiled because the end goal is predefined and we just have to get there. In fact, there is almost always an understanding that the answer is out there, it is just that we don't know it. If we look hard enough we are bound to find it in the depths of the internet - Google almost guarantees it.
But ideating in the real world is exponentially harder, because the goals are not always clear. If you are in a large organization or starting up or even part of a team in a startup that is trying to start a new project, most requirements follow from one of two points:
* Implement a business or technology goal that will make the business money.
* Implement a workflow that may not make the business money but will have some set of people who have live improving value in it.

Lets spend some time breaking these two points down. 

## Building for profit
Whether your company is a capitistic for-profit or even a not-for-profit, chances are your still need to worry about how you are going to pay for costs of running the business. There are salaries to be paid and lights to be kept on. However not-for-profits are bound to feed back whatever operating profits that are made into the business itself. For-profit companies will distribute the money to share-holders and founders who are then free to use this money for their personal reasons to feedback into the ecosystem.

This long explanation is to say that fundamentally all that gets built in a company has to, through some roundabout way, answer for how that is going to make money. While an engineer or even a senior engineer may be far removed from having to answer this question in a large company, it is the bread and butter of any small team. A mistake made all too often by engineers of any level of experience is that they build for the love of building something, and many times it is not too clear how to monetize what they have built or even if there is any way it can improve productivity.

A caveat here is, not all work has to have direct dollar signs attached to them. It can be as simple as improving the workflow of the customer service team that can allow them to increase throughput (number of customer queries resolved per hour) that will lead to more customers that will then increase the business revenue.

## Building for free
Not all people of companies fall under the category mentioned above. Some organizations build software for public good. Major examples are those that come from the government. The software that allows you book an appointment at the passport office or any other government service have been built to help society by allowing the government to efficiently fulfill its duty. For example, one of the driving factors is here is the number of appointments issued given free slots and the number of people who want to issue one. The closer to 100% the software is in this ratio, the more successful it is. Since this is a necessary service given to citizens by the government, the main aim is not how much money it is, but the happiness of its customers, i.e., the citizens of the country. 

Alternatively there are many complex economies at play for giving away something for free. Some companies are designed to give away work for free or token amounts. Examples include the free software movement, operating systems such as linux, and companies such as Canonical, the makers of the Ubuntu OS. If Microsoft and Apple can make a lot of money selling Windows and MacOS-based systems respectively, why would Canonical want to give away Ubuntu for free. There are many reasons one of which is Ubuntu is open-source and built by the community which means it is only fair they release it back to the community for free. How do they make money? After all the CEO of Ubuntu is one of richest men in the world. They make money by selling support to enterprise customers.

## Building for Value.
But given both of these sections, the common denominator is they are both building for value. In both cases, the truest acid-test of the success of a product is if whether people are using it or not. To make a profit first you have to make a revenue and to make a revenue, people will have to want to use your product and pay for it. And they will pay for it only if they find value. In the second case, the reason you are building something is to have people use it and better their own lives or society, and people are not going to use it if doesn't deliver them value. 

## How do you find the Value?
It is easy to retrospectively laud successful companies, projects and people, without considering the multiple companies that tried and failed on the way. For example, we all know Facebook as one of the most successful social media platforms of the last decade, but how many of us remember Orkut and its demise. This retrospective judgement of a space or sector by looking at only those who were successful and not considering the failures on the way is called *survivorship bias.*

The issue with survivorship bias is it does not paint a true picture of what it really was for these companies before they were deemed succesful. Many people will look at *Lufthansa* or *Emirates* as examples of how to run an airline, but what about the countless other airlines that ran and closed up?
Most of the founders of these companies would believe that what they are the next billion dollar company. But only a few of them were right.

There is no covering up, finding value is a hard task. Not least due to the multiple factors that finally deam the product valuable. For any product, the proof is only in the pudding. It can be deemed valuable only if people have actually used it and are paying for it. Predicting a product is valuable before it actually is lies in the realm of tech pundits and venture capilitists. Startup founders to play the game will also have to tout the predicted value in their product before actually showing it if they have hopes of raising capital from investors. However, the success rate for startups are in the low single digit percentage points (proof?). That means your startup is nine times out of ten going to fail than succeed.

These seems very stark, and might put you off your course and make you rethink starting up, but it is not. We hope this is just a coffee shot that you need and probably hold on to understand that at no point in your journey can you relax and you need to constantly keep reevaluating whether you are still showing value or you are not.

## Can you be more pointed?

Sure, to be more pointed we can deliver different take aways from this section to different readers:

### Startup Founders
  
Depending on where you are on your journey you may feel we are only preaching to the choir here. If you have already started up, raised capital and a team, you may have already done the exercise of describing potential value in your product multiple times, to mutliple startup meets and investors. If you are early in your journey or are just about thinking of taking the leap in to starting up, this can be a very important step.

Many founders especially those from an engineering background may have cool tech but have no idea about whether it is actually valuable (projected or not) or can improve the lives of their users in such a way that they would pay money for the product. If you fall under this category, the takeaway is always be clear about the value of your idea. The whole point of the startup is to prove the value before you become a full blown company that is cruising along the market.

### Product Managers 

If you are a product manager or vice-president of a new product in a larger company, a large portion of your journey designing, building and proving value will be the same as the founder of a startup. The only difference would be those who are external investors in a startup would now be the higher up decision-makers in your organization. That and the fact that you will have more help given the other existing teams in the organization, but that depends on how green-field your project is. 

Few times a project may come from above but this would still rests on your shoulders to define the value, define the roadmap to get there, and prove that the value has been attained.

### Team leads and New Engineers

If anyone the page should have the most effect on, it is on early career engineers. It is all too easy for you, if you are engineer reading this, to wear blinders and concentrate on small portions of work that have been handed to you from above, but one trick that can help you grow is in asking this question continuously. Don't hesitate to ask yourself first and then ask your peers and those ranked higher than you in the organization, what the value is in what you are building. Breaking down the product, its possible value and impact can not only benefit you but also how you engineer your work. 

For example, if you are the front-end engineer working on a consumer app, you may learn from your decision maker that any point speed and functionality are more important than aesthetics. If your task involves something as simple (it is not that simple) placing a new button, and you now have a choice between one implementation that can be aesthetic, but you have to sacrifice speed or download a new package that will increase the load time, you already know your answer. 

And if you have a personal opinion, you can even share it, sometimes you would be the only one who knows the trade-off between two packages, and if you understand the mindset of the decision makers you can probably already make the decision for them, and when you tell them you did and they agree it was the right decision, that is time and cognitive load saved for you and them.

## I understand finding value is hard statistically, but why is it?

### Tech disruption
Some early businesses are set up in a way that they take an existing business model and apply it to a new geography or set of customers that were not traditiionally served. Think your local grocery store. There is nothing novel about the concept of a grocery store and nor should there be. If a new grocery store appears in your neigbourhood, it is probably because the entrepreneur thinks that people are underserved in that geographical area. 

One of the aspects in the unnofficial definition of a startup is tech disruption. It generally means that an idea and subsequent implementation challenged status quo and changed the way things were done. We'll look at some examples from different times in the last 150 years to today: 

 * From the past, think about the transition from horse-drawn carriages to motor cars. The invention and subsequent sales of motor cars, disrupted the status-quo of horse-drawn carriages being the means of transport in a city for those who could afford them. If you see a horse-drawn carriage today it is mostly as a novelty. 

 * A more recent example is the advent of the internet disrupting the status quo of telegrams and postal systems due to the speed and efficiency of emails.

 * An even more recent example is the advent of **ecommerce** - buying and selling goods on the internet to have them later delivered home. Many of these disruptions take time and whiles some happen overnight, some may take years. It remains to be seen whether the ecommerce is going to completely remove brick-and-mortar stores or going to live along side them. Depending on where you look you'll find convincing opinions for both sides of the debate on the internet and the newspapers from tech pundits - those who use their knowledge and experience to comment on the present and future of a particular space of innovation in tech.

 * And not all new technology that is touted as the future will also end up showing that value. The long term lasting effects of recent innovations like blockchain and NFTs are still to be proven. 

### Disruption or Pushing a Wall?
Most startups claim that they are have the potential to dirupt status quo. While that may be true, and generally good to believe, it is also notoriously hard to change status quo. If you need users to pay for what your service or product it should do one or more of the following things:

 - **Speeding up an existing process**: Earlier to buy shares and take part in stock trading, one had to use the services of a broker, who would take orders by a telephone, call their colleague on the trading floor and the colleague would place the order with the exchange. One can imagine how many steps this requires. And given the number of humans involved, the process is going to be prone to errors and high variability. In the early 2000's most exchanges moved to trading online. This has reduced the time taken to place an order to less than a second, increasing trade volume and improved efficiency.

 - **Increasing availability**: Except in some specific cases that involve agriculture or similar interests most businesses that have a physical side of it start in urban areas giving priority to the largests geogrpahically or culturally. Therefore just because an idea exists in implementation it doesn't mean it has found a way to scale across geographies or people. Therefore a startup that can take an existing idea that works for one set of geographies or people and is able to apply it to another set of people is also disruptive to the society that those people live in.  

 - **Making goods and services cheaper**: The improved range and speed of communication that the internet enables, quite literally decreases costs due to the concept of **economies of scale**. One example is that of cab-hailing platforms. Taxies existed before but it was always a pain to hail one. Drivers would have to roam the streets in search of possible riders. By increasing availability the costs attributed to roaming and waiting for the drivers have reduced. Amazon AWS or other cloud services lease computers that can be accessed over the internet for computation. Earlier if a company needed a server, they would have to build and assemble one, and if it is not being used all the time, it is just wasted costs. But with AWS, a comany can lease the computer for exactly the amount of time they are using it, paying for only what they use. This decreases overall costs since, through AWS, multiple companies are using sharing the costs for the actual physical server at Amazon's premises.  

 - **Access to Goods, Content or Services**: Though Netflix and YouTube were the disrupters for how movies, TV shows and videos are consumed with access to content on demand. Food ordering applications disrupted how restaurant patrons buy food from restaurants. These business took existing ideas of content suppliers and food delivery and improved the accessibility, reach and speed, through the use of improved workflows for both the users, restaurants and delivery personal. What would have earlier meant having individual restaurant staff being able to take orders, the restaurant having delivery persons employed and users know what and how to order from a particular has to now moved to a shared economy where the user has access to more restaurants and is able to discover more dishes and locations, the restaurant can reduce costs by offloading the ordering and delivery process to the food delivering business.

 Does your idea do any one of these? The more number of the above attributes it has the better it is. It may become very hard to make money if none of these aspects are there to your business, because it may become hard to ask people to part with their money for your goods or service. There are a lot of goods and service out there that are competing for the same amount of money, time or energy that is available to people, they have to be incentivised to give you that money that they could have spent elsewhere or saved up for later, and there is not better incentive than to feel like this was money well spent.

 ## Building a Moat
 Over time if it so happens that you and your company are one of the lucky ones that were able to find this value, this raises a new problem for you. Other companies will want to have their piece of the pie and enter your space. Again there would be multiple factors that govern how much of your pie they are going to grab. We cover this in more details on this page.

## Sustainability
We have spoken about value being a driving force for understanding what you are trying to build, but we haven't spoken about the sobering counter-balance of, 'at what cost is this value provided?'

As enumerated below, this cost doesn't have to necessary only mean money, but also laws and ethics. We cover some of these in more detail in later chapters but a few pointers to think about here:

### Money 
In the lifecycle of a startup, one generates capital, kickstarts the business and then the business is supposed to power itself. This can only happen if the idea is able to generate money. We have aluded to this when talking about value, when we mentioned that a measure of how valuable an idea is if someone is willing to pay for the value they see from your idea. Any of the old big businesses have gotten there by posting profits year on year and these profits have come from end users.

There are also multiple ideas that sound very good on paper and pretty valuable, but unfortunately there is not possible path to profitability. For example, taxi-hailing companies have become so intertwined with our lives now that we can't imagine a world without them. But there is a fine-line that they tread between ride costs, paying the driver and running their business. There is an upper limit of how much a rider is willing to pay for a given ride distance given their budgets. And there is a lower limit below which the business is just not tenable for the driver. If the cost of paying the driver, and running their business go above the upper limit their customer base is willing to pay, the business becomes unviable.

You will have to make this kind of long term analysis over the idea to see whether there is even scope of long term profitability. And as mentioned earlier the proof is only in the pudding and implementation. But if aren't at least able to explain a path to profitability, to is going to be very difficult for the path to suddenly appear.

### Law and Ethics
There are many ideas out there that probably can make money and be valuable, but are not allowed by hard laws. For example, some countries have a list of banned goods that cannot be sold. You probably will not be allowed to start a business and can potential make yourself vulnerable to litigation if you try. There are many business ideas that stradle this line of what is lawful and fall under the grey area. It is always best to ratify your idea with lawyers if you feel there is a need to.

There is an even looser line of what is an ethical business, and while the law can be fuzzy in some cases, ethics can be notororiously fuzzy, and informed by politics in many cases. We shall cover ethics in a later chapter. But when thinking of your idea you should consider such questions. For example, in grocery delivery businesses it is not lawful to pay a minimum wage to delivery personel and make them work till the maximum allowed hours per day. However, is it ethical, would you as a software engineer agree to work for minimum wages at a company just because the company can legally do so?

Another case is the sale of personal data. Some websites make some extra money by sharing personal data that they have collected from users that use their site. Since this is a new age problem in many jurisdictions the law is not very clear on what is allowed. And even if they are, in many cases it is less that what many people are comfortable with. So you will have to worry about if your business model is based on something that is legally allowed but what many users will be uncomforable even using your application?
 
## The Gap - putting two things together
There is a saying among those who research and search for extra terristorial life, 'extraordinary claims require extra ordinary proofs.' This means that any signs of alien life can and will be accepted only if the proof is beyond reproachable. The opposite effect is if the claim is too good to be true, it probably is not. In the world of startups, bigger financial or value return a startup idea has the more it the bigger and unreproachable the idea should be.

The way to do that is to stand on the shoulders of giants, i.e., the work of people that have come before you and understand where the gap is in their implementation. This is where innovation lies. For example, somebody originally took the concept of taxies added communications and geo-locations that that smart phones supply and created the ride hailing apps.

Similarly, someone - Netflix - took recommendations engines - an engine that suggests new content based on the content you have just consumed - and applied them to movies to create movie recommending sites, some one else - Spotify - saw the success there and applied them to music.

This means the gap may be the algorithm or the space to which an algorithm is applied to. When trying to ideate, it is best to read and understand your particular domain really well, then read beyond the domain to see what algorithms or trade tricks others are applying their space and see whether you can apply the same the your space and then ask whether all of the above discussion about value, money and ethics apply to this space. If it does then you have identified a potential gap and now only have to execute and serve the pudding as proof.

How does this tie in with the setence mentions above, 'extraordinary claims require extra ordinary proofs.' If you take an existing algorithm and apply it to a new space, it may be easier for stakeholder to draw parallels, like in the case of applying recommendation engines to music content. It is easier to use the success in movie recommendations to say it will now work for music. It would have been relatively harder to prove the potential in ride-hailing apps before it was a phenomenon, because it was unclear whether drivers would want to use it and break away from status quo or not. It would be even harder to talk about cab hailing if your business involved setting up of taxi services also. When the time came to set up local delivery service, the success of drivers willing to use applications to get rides were used as the starting point when the entire new fleet of delivery persons had to be created in the ecosystem when there were none.

## Should you even try to do this?
Given what is written here, starting a startup journey, or heck, even working for one may seem very intimidating. First one has to come up with an original idea and then prove value and make money. Why even go through it one may ask.

The answer can be a very personal one. Many people like the thrill of building something and others like the potential jackpot that this journey promises even if it is risky.

But the main takeaway from this page is that once you are on this journey are even working for a startup, being cognizant of the risks involved can go a long way to help mitigate the unfavourable outcomes. The startup world moves fast and there are always multiple factors but the best of whom survive have a at least a thumb on all these aspects. This book, therefore tries to give an engineers spin on starting up from an engineers point of view. The best way to look at it is, once you have the this toolkit under your belt, atleast all you have to worry about are external market forces, which is what the game is anyway. 

## The Value Questionnaire
As a conclusion, the following questionnaire compiles questions that you may ask yourself to understand your proposed idea better and whether from your given understanding at the moment it has any potential for value of not.
1. Who are you creating this for.
1. How are they going to use it.
1. If this product didn't exist what is the current method your potential users use to get the same end point.
1. Is your product going speed up the process, make it more efficient, increase availability or improve the content available?
1. Does your product have a path to profitability?
1. Is your product legal and ethical to your best knowledge?
